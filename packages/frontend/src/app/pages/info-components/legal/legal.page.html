  <h4>RecipeSage Sharing Policy</h4>
  <p>
    RecipeSage has several wonderful sharing features that allow you to share
    &amp; collaborate with other users.<br />
    This can however, lead to some users abusing that functionality.
    <br /><br />
    By using these sharing features, you agree that you will only upload &amp;
    share content that you have the license to, including (but not limited to):
    any text content of the recipe, images, notes, and title.<br />
    Recipes are often very similar to eachother, and we know that it can be a
    fine line here. We expect that you as the user will follow fair use laws,
    and will do your best not to use RecipeSage to share copyrighted content
    that you don't have the rights to.
    <br /><br />
    <b>The most important part</b> - If we're notified by a copyright holder of
    copyrighted content present publicly, for example on your profile, we will
    need to take action. We'll always notify you if this is the case. Our
    actions may include (but are not limited to): removing the copyrighted
    content from your public profile or disabling your public profile

    this timeframe may be considered in compliance with local laws, which will
    dictate the applicable refund period. Refund requests will be reviewed on a
    case-by-case basis, and approval for refunds outside the standard period
